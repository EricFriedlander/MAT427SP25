    "text": "Instructor\nEric is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics and Physical Sciences at the College of Idaho. His expertise lies in the areas of probability, statistics, and statistics education. He joined the College of Idaho faculty in 2024 after spending three years as an Assistant Professor at St. Norbert College in De Pere, Wisconsin. He received his bachelor’s degree in mathematics and statistics from Rice University in 2011. After earning his degree, he worked for Capital One for two years in their home loans division before enrolling in graduate school. In 2018, Eric received his Ph.D. in statistics and operations research from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill studying under professor Amarjit Budhiraja. His dissertation work focused on modeling and analyzing large systems which arise in industrial engineering (e.g. large server and communication networks). Following his Ph.D., Eric did a postdoc in the Department of Ecology & Evolution at the University of Chicago under the direction of professor Matthias Steinrücken where he used stochastic processes to study natural selection and population genetics.\nOutside of school, Eric is an avid fan of the New York Giants, New York Knicks, and North Carolina Tarheels. In addition, he enjoys comic books, the Fast and the Furious franchise, and spending time with his lovely wife Maria and lovable dogs Allie, Tony, and Miriam."

We will practice using AI to facilitate—rather than hinder—learning.\n(2) Ethical dimension: Students using AI should be transparent about their use and make sure it aligns with academic integrity.\n\n\nThese guiding principles are based on Course Policies related to ChatGPT and other AI Tools developed by Joel Gladd, Ph.D.↩︎"

However, if you do so, you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code and AI should serve as a learning aid, not a replacement for thinking.\n❌ No AI tools for narrative: Unless instructed otherwise, AI is not permitted for writing narrative on assignments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\nIn general, you may use AI as a resource as you complete assignments but not to answer the exercises for you. You are ultimately responsible for the work you turn in; it should reflect your understanding of the course content. Any code or content from your homework is eligible for inclusion during your job interview."
