    "text": "Course community\n\nCollege of Idaho Honor Code\n\nThe College of Idaho maintains that academic honesty and integrity are essential values in the educational process. Operating under an Honor Code philosophy, the College expects conduct rooted in honesty, integrity, and understanding, allowing members of a diverse student body to live together and interact and learn from one another in ways that protect both personal freedom and community standards. Violations of academic honesty are addressed primarily by the instructor and may be referred to the Student Judicial Board.\n\nBy participating in this course, you are agreeing that all your work and conduct will be in accordance with the College of Idaho Honor Code.\n\n\nDisability Accommodation Statement\nThe College of Idaho seeks to provide an educational environment that is accessible to the needs of students with disabilities. The College provides reasonable services to enrolled students who have a documented permanent or temporary physical, psychological, learning, intellectual, or sensory disability that qualifies the student for accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act or section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. If you have, or think you may have, a disability that impacts your performance as a student in this class, you are encouraged to arrange support services and/or accommodations through the Department of Accessibility and Learning Excellence located in McCain 201B and available via email at accessibility@collegeofidaho.edu. Reasonable academic accommodations may be provided to students who submit appropriate and current documentation of their disability. Accommodations can be arranged only through this process and are not retroactively applied. More information can be found on the DALE webpage (https://www.collegeofidaho.edu/accessibility).\n\n\nCommunication\nAll lecture notes, assignment instructions, an up-to-date schedule, and other course materials may be found on the course website, mat427fa25.netlify.app.\nPeriodic announcements will be sent via email and will also be available through Canvas and grades will be stored in the Canvas gradebook. Please check your email regularly to ensure you have the latest announcements for the course.\n\n\nIn class agreements\nIf we discuss/agree to something in class or office hours which requires action from me (e.g. “you may turn in your homework late due to a sporting event”), you MUST send me a follow-up message. If you don’t, I will almost certainly forget, and our agreement will be considered null and void.\n\n\nGetting help in the course\n\nIf you have a question during lecture or lab, feel free to ask it! There are likely other students with the same question, so by asking you will create a learning opportunity for everyone.\nI am here to help you be successful in the course. You are encouraged to attend office hours and the homework lab to ask questions about the course content and assignments. Many questions are most effectively answered as you discuss them with others, so office hours are a valuable resource. You are encouraged to use them!\nOutside of class and office hours, any general questions about course content or assignments can be emailed to me.\n\n\n\nEmail\nIf you have questions about assignment extensions or accommodations, please email efriedlander@collegeofidaho.edu.

    "text": "Assignments\nYou will be assessed based on five components: homework, job applications, job interviews, a hack-a-thon, and project.\n\nHomework\nIn homework, you will apply what you’ve learned during lecture to complete data analysis tasks. Homework will completed in teams of three, must be typed up using Quarto, and submitted as .qmd and .pdf files in via GitHub.\n\n\nJob Applications & Job Interviews\nDuring this course you will apply to two “jobs”. I will generate the job advertisements including real companies and base the job description on the course content and similar job advertisements that I get from online or professional collaborators. Each job application will have three components:\n\nA cover letter.\nA resume.\nA portfolio.\n\nAll three of these should be tailored to the job description and the company to which you are applying. Your portfolio will consist of self-contained data analyses of your choosing. The most straight forward method of creating th to repurpose your homeworks, converting them from a format in which you are responding to exercises to something where you are telling a narrative and demonstrating that you meet the job criteria. To create your portfolio, you will be required to create a website. More details on this will be given during the semester, however the idea of this project is that you will be able to use the things you general when you are applying for jobs.\nAfter you submit your job applications, you will be invited to schedule a one-hour long job interview. It is your job to schedule your job interview with Dr. Friedlander. Each job interview will have three portions. The first, lasting 10-15 minutes, will include typical questions that apply to almost any job interview (e.g. “What are your biggest strengths and weaknesses”). The second, lasting 20-30 minutes, will include questions about the portfolio you submitted and your understanding of the required skills described in the job advertising. The third section will mimic what is called a “case interview”. Case interviews are extremely common for many jobs, especially those requiring quantitative or computational skills, and can be intimidating. During the case interview portion, you will be presented with a “case study” and asked questions on how you would go about approaching it. The cases themselves will be designed so that they can be solved using the content from class. The goal of this whole exercise is to assess your knowledge of the course content in a way that is authentic while also preparing you to get a job.\n\n\nHack-a-thon\nAt some point in the semester we will participate in a “Hack-a-thon” as a class. Namely, you will be given a short period of time (1-3 days) to build a model and make a set of predictions. After the competition is over, you will be required to present on your model. Part of your score will be determine by how well your model performs and extra credit will be given to the top scoring individuals.\n\n\nProject\nDuring the latter portion of the course, you will complete a final project that involves a deep exploration of a problem. More details for the final project will be provided later in the course.",

    "text": "Course policies\n\nAcademic honesty\nTL;DR: Don’t cheat!\n\nThe job application assignments must be completed individually but you are welcome to discuss the assignment with classmates (e.g., discuss what’s the best way for approaching a problem, what functions are useful for accomplishing a particular task, etc.). However you may not directly share (i.e. via copy/paste or copying) any code or prose with anyone other than myself.\nFor the hack-a-thon, everyone will submit their predictions and give their own presentations. However, you are encouraged to work together. You are allowed to share code with one another. However, everyone should be able to explain what they did and everyone’s projects should be unique in some way. Point reductions will be given if two individuals submit the exact same predictions.\nFor the projects, collaboration within teams is not only allowed, but expected. Communication between teams at a high level is also allowed however you may not share code or components of the project across teams.\nReusing code: Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\nUse of artificial intelligence (AI): You should treat AI tools, such as ChatGPT, the same as other online resources. There are two guiding principles that govern how you can use AI in this course:1 (1) Cognitive dimension: Working with AI should not reduce your ability to think clearly. We will practice using AI to facilitate—rather than hinder—learning. (2) Ethical dimension: Students using AI should be transparent about their use and make sure it aligns with academic integrity. In general if the following two things are not true, you are cheating:\n\nYou understand and can explain all of the code you have written down or you don’t and you have cited the source of that code.\nAll of your prose and narrative were written by yourself.\n\n\nIf you are unsure if the use of a particular resource complies with the academic honesty policy, just ask.\nRegardless of course delivery format, it is the responsibility of all students to understand and follow all College of Idaho policies, including academic integrity (e.g., completing one’s own work, following proper citation of sources, adhering to guidance around group work projects, and more). Ignoring these requirements is a violation of the Honor Code.\n\n\nLate work policy\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback within a timely manner. I understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline.\n\nLate Homework: Homework is completion based and well be accepted without penalty for a week. However, if your homework is turned in after I begin grading it, you will not receive any feedback.\nSchool-Sponsored Events/Illness: If an assignment or meeting must be missed due to a school-sponsored event, you must let me know at least a week ahead of time so that we can schedule a time for you to make up the work before you leave. If an assignment or meeting must be missed due to illness, you must let me know as soon as it is safe for you to do so and before the assignment or meeting if possible. Failure to adhere to this policy will result in a 35% penalty on the corresponding assignment.",

I really like the following definition, which comes from this article (though it’s probably not the original source).\n\nExploratory Data Analysis refers to the critical process of performing initial investigations on data so as to discover patterns, spot anomalies, to test hypotheses and to check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.\n\nBefore you begin your exploratory analysis, you may already have a particular question in mind. For example, you might work for an online retailer and want to develop a model to predict which purchased items will be returned. Or, you may not have a particular question in mind. Instead, you might just be asked to look at browsing data for several customers and figure out some way to increase purchases. In either case, before you construct a fancy model, you need to explore and understand your data. This is how you gain new insights and determine if an idea is worth pursuing."

The data in the TIPS dataset is information recorded by one waiter about each tip he received over a period of a few months working in a restaurant. We would like to use this data to address the question, “What factors affect tipping behavior?”\n\nExercise 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nInstall the regclass package by either typing install.packages(\"regclass\") in the console or by clicking “Tools &gt; Install Packages” and selecting the package.

What format is our data in? What types of information are included in the data set? How many observations are there?\n\n\nExercise 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nIn R, data sets are usually stored in a 2-dimensional structure called a data frame. The tidyverse provides a lot of useful functions for a variety of applications including data exploration and the particular flavor of data frame that the tidyverse uses is called a tibble. After loading the tidyverse library, you can get an idea of the structure of a data set using the syntax str(dataset) or glimpse(data), and you can peak at the first few rows and columns with head(dataset). Create a code chunk below, and use these functions (and others) in the R chunk below to better understand the data. How many tips are recorded in this data set? Which days of the week did the waiter work?\n\n\nOften, a data set will come with a code book which gives more complete information about the structure of the data, the meaning of variables, and how the data were collected. In this case, most of the column names are pretty self explanatory.\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nTipPercentage\nthe gratuity, as a percentage of the bill\n\n\nBill\nthe cost of the meal in US dollars\n\n\nTip\nthe tip in US dollars\n\n\nGender\ngender of the bill payer\n\n\nSmoker\nwhether the party included smokers\n\n\nWeekday\nday of the week\n\n\nTime\ntime the bill was paid\n\n\nPartySize\nsize of the party\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nEven though the column names are self-explanatory, we might have more questions about the data. For example, we might conjecture that people tip differently for breakfast and lunch, but our data only tells us if the bill was paid at “Day” or “Night.” State another reasonable conjecture about a factor that might affect tipping behavior. What additional information would be helpful to explore that conjecture?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRender-Commit-Push\n\n\n\nThis is a good place to render, commit, and push changes to your hw-eda repo on GitHub. Write an informative commit message (e.g. “Completed exercises 1 - 3”), and push every file to GitHub by clicking the checkbox next to each file in the Git pane. After you push the changes, the Git pane in RStudio should be empty."

    "section": "Graphical Summaries",
    "text": "Graphical Summaries\nGraphical summaries are a key tool in exploratory data analysis to to help you understand your data. They also help you communicate insights about your data to others. For example, we might want to display relationships about some of our categorical variables. So we could start by graphing different party sizes in our data set.\n\nTIPS |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = PartySize)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr we could explore the question about the percentage of tables that are smokers on different days of the week visually.\n\nTIPS |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = Weekday, fill = Smoker)) +\n    geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIPS |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = Weekday, fill = Smoker)) +\n    geom_bar(position = \"fill\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe might summarize a numerical variable with a histogram. For example, here is a histogram of all of the tips in the data set.\n\nTIPS |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = Tip)) +\n    geom_histogram(bins = 100)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nNotice that there are a few “spikes” in the histogram above. What do you think is causing this?\n\n\nWe can also summarize this numerical data broken down by one of the categorical variables using boxplots, violin plots, or sina plots. Note that to create sina plots we need the ggforce package.\n\nTIPS |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x=Weekday, y=Tip)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Tips by Day of the Week\", \n       x = \"Day of the Week\",\n       y = \"Tips\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIPS |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x=Weekday, y=Tip)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  geom_jitter() +\n  labs(title = \"Tips by Day of the Week\", \n       x = \"Day of the Week\",\n       y = \"Tips\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIPS |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x=Weekday, y=Tip)) +\n  geom_violin() +\n  labs(title = \"Tips by Day of the Week\", \n       x = \"Day of the Week\",\n       y = \"Tips\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(ggforce)\nTIPS |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x=Weekday, y=Tip)) +\n  geom_sina() +\n  labs(title = \"Tips by Day of the Week\", \n       x = \"Day of the Week\",\n       y = \"Tips\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr we can visualize the relationship between a lot of our numerical variables at once.\n\n# Using pairs (only numerical allowed)\npairs(~ Bill + TipPercentage + Tip\n    , data = TIPS\n    , main=\"Scatterplot Matrix for TIPS\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Using ggpairs from GGally package (preferable even though more syntax)\nlibrary(GGally)\nTIPS |&gt; \n  select(Bill, TipPercentage, Tip, Weekday) |&gt; \n  ggpairs()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nAre there any clear linear relationships in the scatterplots above? What do you think is the explanation for these relationships?\n\n\nThere are lots of other interesting graphical summaries available for interpreting and displaying data. In addition, there are lots of R packages that allow you to draw these graphics and to further customize some of the ones we discussed here. In your projects, you are welcome to use any of these that you think are appropriate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRender-Commit-Push\n\n\n\nThis is a good place to render, commit, and push changes to your hw-eda repo on GitHub. Write an informative commit message (e.g. “Completed exercises 7 - 8”), and push every file to GitHub by clicking the checkbox next to each file in the Git pane. After you push the changes, the Git pane in RStudio should be empty.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nState a reasonable conjecture about tipping behavior that you would like to explore in the data set. For example, you might think that people on dates tip more or that the waiter gets smaller tips when he has too many tables. Give at least one numerical and one graphical summary to explore this conjecture. Is there any evidence to support your conjecture?\nIt’s okay if your conjecture is not supported or if you are just wrong–that’s often the case in exploratory data analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRender-Commit-Push\n\n\n\nThis is a good place to render, commit, and push changes to your hw-eda repo on GitHub. Write an informative commit message (e.g. “Completed exercises 9”), and push every file to GitHub by clicking the checkbox next to each file in the Git pane. After you push the changes, the Git pane in RStudio should be empty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nBefore you’re done with you work, make sure you look it over one last time to make sure the rendered document looks like you want it to! I can’t tell you how often students turn in work and their output doesn’t match their prose or the output definitely doesn’t look the way they wanted it to."
