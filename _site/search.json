His expertise lies in the areas of probability, statistics, and statistics education. He joined the College of Idaho faculty in 2024 after spending three years as an Assistant Professor at St. Norbert College in De Pere, Wisconsin. He received his bachelor’s degree in mathematics and statistics from Rice University in 2011. After earning his degree, he worked for Capital One for two years in their home loans division before enrolling in graduate school. In 2018, Eric received his Ph.D. in statistics and operations research from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill studying under professor Amarjit Budhiraja. His dissertation work focused on modeling and analyzing large systems which arise in industrial engineering (e.g. large server and communication networks). Following his Ph.D., Eric did a postdoc in the Department of Ecology & Evolution at the University of Chicago under the direction of professor Matthias Steinrücken where he used stochastic processes to study natural selection and population genetics.\nOutside of school, Eric is an avid fan of the New York Giants, New York Knicks, and North Carolina Tarheels. In addition, he enjoys comic books, the Fast and the Furious franchise, and spending time with his lovely wife Maria and lovable dogs Allie, Tony, and Miriam."

I really like the following definition, which comes from this article (though it’s probably not the original source).\n\nExploratory Data Analysis refers to the critical process of performing initial investigations on data so as to discover patterns, spot anomalies, to test hypotheses and to check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.\n\nBefore you begin your exploratory analysis, you may already have a particular question in mind. For example, you might work for an online retailer and want to develop a model to predict which purchased items will be returned. Or, you may not have a particular question in mind. Instead, you might just be asked to look at browsing data for several customers and figure out some way to increase purchases. In either case, before you construct a fancy model, you need to explore and understand your data. This is how you gain new insights and determine if an idea is worth pursuing."

What format is our data in? What types of information are included in the data set? How many observations are there?\n\n\nExercise 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nIn R, data sets are usually stored in a 2-dimensional structure called a data frame. The tidyverse provides a lot of useful functions for a variety of applications including data exploration and the particular flavor of data frame that the tidyverse uses is called a tibble. After loading the tidyverse library, you can get an idea of the structure of a data set using the syntax str(dataset) or glimpse(data), and you can peak at the first few rows and columns with head(dataset). Create a code chunk below, and use these functions (and others) in the R chunk below to better understand the data. How many tips are recorded in this data set? Which days of the week did the waiter work?\n\n\nOften, a data set will come with a code book which gives more complete information about the structure of the data, the meaning of variables, and how the data were collected. In this case, most of the column names are pretty self explanatory.\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nTipPercentage\nthe gratuity, as a percentage of the bill\n\n\nBill\nthe cost of the meal in US dollars\n\n\nTip\nthe tip in US dollars\n\n\nGender\ngender of the bill payer\n\n\nSmoker\nwhether the party included smokers\n\n\nWeekday\nday of the week\n\n\nTime\ntime the bill was paid\n\n\nPartySize\nsize of the party\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nEven though the column names are self-explanatory, we might have more questions about the data. For example, we might conjecture that people tip differently for breakfast and lunch, but our data only tells us if the bill was paid at “Day” or “Night.” State another reasonable conjecture about a factor that might affect tipping behavior. What additional information would be helpful to explore that conjecture?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRender-Commit-Push\n\n\n\nThis is a good place to render, commit, and push changes to your hw-eda repo on GitHub. Write an informative commit message (e.g. “Completed exercises 1 - 3”), and push every file to GitHub by clicking the checkbox next to each file in the Git pane.

    "text": "Graphical Summaries\nGraphical summaries are a key tool in exploratory data analysis to to help you understand your data. They also help you communicate insights about your data to others. For example, we might want to display relationships about some of our categorical variables. So we could start by graphing different party sizes in our data set.\n\nTIPS |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = PartySize)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr we could explore the question about the percentage of tables that are smokers on different days of the week visually.\n\nTIPS |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = Weekday, fill = Smoker)) +\n    geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIPS |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = Weekday, fill = Smoker)) +\n    geom_bar(position = \"fill\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe might summarize a numerical variable with a histogram.

What do you think is causing this?\n\n\nWe can also summarize this numerical data broken down by one of the categorical variables using boxplots, violin plots, or sina plots. Note that to create sina plots we need the ggforce package.\n\nTIPS |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x=Weekday, y=Tip)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Tips by Day of the Week\", \n       x = \"Day of the Week\",\n       y = \"Tips\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIPS |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x=Weekday, y=Tip)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  geom_jitter() +\n  labs(title = \"Tips by Day of the Week\", \n       x = \"Day of the Week\",\n       y = \"Tips\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIPS |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x=Weekday, y=Tip)) +\n  geom_violin() +\n  labs(title = \"Tips by Day of the Week\", \n       x = \"Day of the Week\",\n       y = \"Tips\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(ggforce)\nTIPS |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x=Weekday, y=Tip)) +\n  geom_sina() +\n  labs(title = \"Tips by Day of the Week\", \n       x = \"Day of the Week\",\n       y = \"Tips\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr we can visualize the relationship between a lot of our numerical variables at once.\n\n# Using pairs (only numerical allowed)\npairs(~ Bill + TipPercentage + Tip\n    , data = TIPS\n    , main=\"Scatterplot Matrix for TIPS\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Using ggpairs from GGally package (preferable even though more syntax)\nlibrary(GGally)\nTIPS |&gt; \n  select(Bill, TipPercentage, Tip, Weekday) |&gt; \n  ggpairs()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nAre there any clear linear relationships in the scatterplots above? What do you think is the explanation for these relationships?\n\n\nThere are lots of other interesting graphical summaries available for interpreting and displaying data. In addition, there are lots of R packages that allow you to draw these graphics and to further customize some of the ones we discussed here. In your projects, you are welcome to use any of these that you think are appropriate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRender-Commit-Push\n\n\n\nThis is a good place to render, commit, and push changes to your hw-eda repo on GitHub. Write an informative commit message (e.g. “Completed exercises 7 - 8”), and push every file to GitHub by clicking the checkbox next to each file in the Git pane. After you push the changes, the Git pane in RStudio should be empty.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nState a reasonable conjecture about tipping behavior that you would like to explore in the data set. For example, you might think that people on dates tip more or that the waiter gets smaller tips when he has too many tables. Give at least one numerical and one graphical summary to explore this conjecture. Is there any evidence to support your conjecture?\nIt’s okay if your conjecture is not supported or if you are just wrong–that’s often the case in exploratory data analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRender-Commit-Push\n\n\n\nThis is a good place to render, commit, and push changes to your hw-eda repo on GitHub. Write an informative commit message (e.g. “Completed exercises 9”), and push every file to GitHub by clicking the checkbox next to each file in the Git pane. After you push the changes, the Git pane in RStudio should be empty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nBefore you’re done with you work, make sure you look it over one last time to make sure the rendered document looks like you want it to! I can’t tell you how often students turn in work and their output doesn’t match their prose or the output definitely doesn’t look the way they wanted it to."
