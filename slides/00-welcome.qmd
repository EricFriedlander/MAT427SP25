## Tell me about yourself + GitHub {.smaller}

Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account. You may want to use this to show-off work to future employers so I recommend using something professional (like your name) as your user name.

Send me an email with answers to the following questions:

1. What is the GitHub username you just created?
2. What would you like me to call you?
3. Why are you taking this class?
4. What are your career goals?
5. Is there anything else you would like me to know about you? E.g. athlete, preferred pronouns, accommodations, etc...
6. Please recommend at least one and up to infinity songs for the class playlist.

# MAT 427

## Course FAQ

**Q - What background is assumed for the course?**

A - Familiarity with concepts from statistical inference, linear regression, and logistic regression. A solid grounding in R, including the `tidyverse` and `ggplot`.

## Course FAQ

**Q - Will we be doing computing?**

A - Yes. We will use the computing language R for analysis, Quarto for writing up results, and GitHub for version control and collaboration

## Course FAQ

**Q - Will we learn the mathematical theory?**

A - Yes and No. The course is primarily focused on application; however, we will discuss some of the mathematics occasionally.

## Course FAQ

**Q - What distinguishes this from a 300-level course?**

A - I expect a high level of independence from you. You should not be relying on me to teach you every small detail from this course. For example, if you tell you about an R function, I expect that you will be able to figure out how to use it yourself.

## Course FAQ

**Q - Is there anything else I should know?**

A - Machine learning is a RAPIDLY evolving field. If you want to be successful in this field going forward, you will need to be able to learn things for yourself and SELF-ASSESS whether you know them. There are portions of this course that I have *intentionally* designed to not give you enough information to solve on your own.


## Course learning objectives {.midi}

By the end of the semester, you will be able to...

-   tackle predictive modeling problems arising from real data.

-   use R to fit and evaluate machine learning models.

-   assess whether a proposed model is appropriate and describe its limitations.

-   use Quarto to write reproducible reports and GitHub for version control and collaboration.

-   effectively communicate results results through writing and oral presentations.

## Use of artificial intelligence (AI) {.midi}

-   You should treat AI tools, such as ChatGPT, the same as other online resources.
-   There are two guiding principles that govern how you can use AI in this course:[^1]
    -   \(1\) *Cognitive dimension:* Working with AI should not reduce your ability to think clearly. We will practice using AI to facilitate---rather than hinder---learning.
    -   \(2\) *Ethical dimension***:** Students using AI should be transparent about their use and make sure it aligns with academic integrity.

[^1]: These guiding principles are based on [*Course Policies related to ChatGPT and other AI Tools*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WpCeTyiWCPQ9MNCsFeKMDQLSTsg1oKfNIH6MzoSFXqQ/preview) developed by Joel Gladd, Ph.D.[‚Ü©Ô∏é](https://sta101-f23.github.io/course-syllabus.html#fnref1)

## Use of artificial intelligence (AI) {.midi}

-   Understand everything you write down

-   Tell me where you got it from

-   Don't lie about it

::: callout-important
In general, you may use AI as a resource as you complete assignments but not to answer the exercises for you. You are ultimately responsible for the work you turn in; it should reflect your understanding of the course content. **Any code or content from your homework is eligible for inclusion during your job interview.**
:::

## In class agreements

If we discuss/agree to something in class or office hours which requires action from me (e.g. ‚Äúyou may turn in your homework late due to a sporting event‚Äù), you MUST send me a follow-up message. If you don‚Äôt, I will almost certainly forget, and our agreement will be considered null and void.

# Having a successful semester in MAT 427

## Five tips for success

1.  Complete all the preparation work (readings and videos) before class.

2.  Ask questions, come to office hours and help session.

3.  Do the homework; get started on homework early when possible.

4.  Don't procrastinate and don't let a week pass by with lingering questions.

5.  Stay up-to-date on announcements on Canvas and sent via email.

## Emails for help

# Machine Learning

## What is Machine Learning?

-   Machine Learning is the study of tools/techniques for extracting
    information and making predictions from complex datasets
-   The name machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel
    -   "Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn
        without being explicitly programmed"

## What is Machine Learning?

Tom M. Mitchell (1998):

> A computer program is said to learn from experience **E** with respect
> to some class of tasks **T** and performance measure **P** if its
> performance at tasks in **T**, as measured by **P**, improves with
> experience **E**.

## What is Machine Learning?

![MNIST handwritten digits (from ISLR, James et
al.)](images/01/MNIST-0000000001-2e09631a_09liOmx.jpg)

## [Question!!!]{style="color:blue"}

Suppose your email program watches which emails you do or do not mark as
spam, and based on that learns how to better filter spam. According to
Tom Mitchell's definition, which of the following is the task **T**,
experience **E**, and performance measure **P** in this setting?

-   [**P**]{.fragment .fade-in fragment-index="1"} The number (or
    fraction) of emails correctly classified as spam/ham (not spam)
-   [**T**]{.fragment .fade-in fragment-index="1"} Classifying emails as
    spam or ham
-   [**E**]{.fragment .fade-in fragment-index="1"} Watching you label
    emails as spam or ham

## Statistical Learning vs Machine Learning vs Data Science

-   Machine learning arose as a sub-field of Artificial Intelligence
    which is a sub-fields of Computer Science
-   Statistical learning arose as a sub-field of Statistics
-   There is much overlap, a great deal of "cross-fertilization"
-   "Data Science" - Reflects the fact that both statistical and machine
    learning are about data
-   "Machine Learning" or "Data Science" are "fancier" terms

## Statistics vs Machine Learning

-   Statistics: more concerned with answering why and how things work,
    making inferences
-   Machine/Statistical learning: more concerned with making predictions

## Terminology/Notation {.smaller}

**Ames Housing dataset** - Contains data on 881 houses in Ames, IA. We
are interested in predicting sale price.

The first ten **observations** are shown below.

```{r}
#| echo: false

ames <- readRDS("../data/AmesHousing.rds")
# ames <- ames %>% select(c(1,2,3,5,8,9))
head(ames, 10) |>
  select(1:9) |> 
  kable("html") |> 
  kable_styling(font_size = 12)
```

## Terminologies/Notations {.smaller}

**Default dataset** - Contains credit card default data on 10,000
individuals. We are interested in predicting whether somebody will
default or not.

    predicting, denoted as $Y$
-   **Features/Inputs/Predictors** - variables used to predict the
    response, denoted as $X$
-   **Feature Matrix** - all features taken together, denoted as
    $\mathbf{X}$
-   Number of data points/observations denoted as $n$
-   Number of features/inputs/predictors denotes as $p$

## [Question!!!]{style="color:blue"} {.smaller}

Suppose you have information about 867 cancer patients on their [age,
tumor size, clump thickness of the tumor, uniformity of cell size, and
whether the tumor is malignant or benign]{.fragment .highlight-red
fragment-index="2"}. Based on these data, you are interested in building
a model to predict the type of tumor (malignant or benign) for future
cancer patients.

-   What are the values of $n$ and $p$ in this dataset?
    [$n = 867, p = 5$]{.fragment .fade-in fragment-index="1"}
-   What are the inputs/features?

## Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning

![Machine Learning Tasks (from Bunker and Fayez,
2017)](images/01/Supervised-Learning-versus-Unsupervised-Learning-Mathworks-nd.png){.r-stretch}

## Supervised Learning

-   We have access to **labeled** data
-   Objective: learn overall pattern of relationship between the inputs
    ($\mathbf{X}$) and response ($Y$) in order to
    -   Investigate the relationship between inputs and response
    -   Predict for potential unseen **test** cases
    -   Assess the quality of predictions

## Types of Supervised Learning

Supervised Learning problems can be categorized into:

-   **Regression** problems (response is quantitative, continuous)
-   **Classification** problems (response is qualitative, categorical)

## Unsupervised Learning

-   No response/outcome variable, just $\mathbf{X}$
-   Understand structure within data
    -   find similar groups of observations based on features
        (**clustering**)
    -   find a smaller subset of features with the most variation
        (**dimensionality reduction**)
-   No gold-standard
-   Easier to collect unlabeled data
-   Useful pre-processing step for supervised learning

## Unsupervised Learning {.smaller}

**US Arrests dataset** - Data on arrests for 50 US states.

The first ten observations are shown below.

```{r}
#| echo: false

data("USArrests")
head(USArrests, 10) |> 
  kable("html") |> 
  kable_styling(font_size = 16)
```

## [Question!!!]{style="color:blue"}

::: {style="font-size: 60%;"}
For each of the following, identify whether the problem belongs to the
supervised or unsupervised learning paradigm

-   Examine the statistics of two football teams, and predict which team
    will win tomorrow's match (given historical data of teams'
    wins/losses to learn from) [**supervised**]{.fragment .fade-in}
-   Given genetic (DNA) data from a person, predict the probability of
    the person developing diabetes over the next 10 years
    [**supervised**]{.fragment .fade-in}
-   Take a collection of 1000 essays written on the US economy, and find
    a way to automatically group these essays into a small number of
    groups of essays that are somehow "similar" or "related"
    [**unsupervised**]{.fragment .fade-in}
-   Examine data on the income and years of education of adults in a
    neighborhood and build a model to predict the income from years of
    education [**supervised**]{.fragment .fade-in}
